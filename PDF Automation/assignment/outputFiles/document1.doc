MODULE 2
The Relational Data Model and Relational Database Constraints
and Relational Algebra

2.1 Relational Model Concepts

 Domain: A (usually named) set/universe of atomic values, where by "atomic" we mean
simply that, from the point of view of the database, each value in the domain is indivisible
(i.e., cannot be broken down into component parts). 

Examples of domains (some taken from page 147):

o USA_phone_number: string of digits of length
ten o SSN: string of digits of length nine
o  Name: string of characters beginning with an upper case letter
o  GPA: a real number between 0.0 and 4.0
o  Sex: a member of the set { female, male }
o  Dept_Code: a member of the set { CMPS, MATH, ENGL, PHYS, PSYC, ... }

These are all logical descriptions of domains. For implementation purposes, it is necessary
to provide descriptions of domains in terms of concrete data types (or formats) that are
provided by the DBMS (such as String , int , boolean ), in a manner analogous to how
programming languages have intrinsic data types.

 Attribute: the name of the role played by some value (coming from some domain) in the
 context of a relational schema. The domain of attribute A is denoted dom(A) . 
 Tuple: A tuple is a mapping from attributes to values drawn from the respective domains
of those attributes. A tuple is intended to describe some entity (or relationship between
entities) in the miniworld. 

As an example, a tuple for a PERSON entity might be

{ Name --> "Rumpelstiltskin",  Sex --> Male,  IQ --> 143 }

 Relation: A (named) set of tuples all of the same form (i.e., having the same set of
attributes). The term table is a loose synonym. (Some database purists would argue that a
 table is "only" a physical manifestation of a relation.) 
 Relational Schema: used for describing (the structure of) a relation. E.g., R(A 1 , A 2 , ..., A n )
says that R is a relation with attributes A 1 , ... A n . The degree of a relation is the number of
attributes it has, here n. 
